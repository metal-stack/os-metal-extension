# os-metal-extension

This extension provides controllers to reconcile `OperatingSystemConfig`s and transforms them into [Ignition](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/provisioning/ignition/) userdata. This userdata can be applied during machine provisioning as done by the metal-stack project.

This extension was made for working with operating system images built in the [metal-images](https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-images) repository.
